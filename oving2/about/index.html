    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Vemund Santi was born a hero. Before he even left the womb of his mother, he had already set a world record by
    doing 18 hole-in-ones on a golf course with only a single swing by his golf club. As soon as he was born, he started
    commanding the people around him, being the natural leader he is. By the time he turned five years old, he had
    already reached the summit of Mount Everest, visited Jupiter and lifted a blue whale by himself.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Vemund Santi went to Ski Videreg√•ende with many of his great friends, such as Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and
    John Snow. He soon realized that he was destined to protect the kingdom of China, because the Wall would
    inevitably melt because of global warming. He figured the best way to do that was to invent a new way to
    encrypt data, while still being able to perform arithmetic operations on the data sets.</p>
