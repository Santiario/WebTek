        <model>DigiCam</model>
        <question id="q5">
            What is the difference between optical and digital zoom?
        </question>
        <answer id="a5">
            With optical zoom, the Digicam's lens physically moves inside the camera; with
            digital zoom, the camera's processor zooms the image electronically. If you zoom
            too much, your image will become pixelated.
        </answer>
        <question id="q6">
            What sort of batteries should I use with the DigiCam?
        </question>
        <answer id="a6">
            Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries work the best and have the longest
            lifetime. Nickel-cadium batteries also work very well, as do alkaline batteries.
            Do not use lithium batteries.

            1600×1200 for 8×10-inch photos.

        <question id="q8">
            Can the DigiCam be harmed by airport X-ray machines?
        </question>
        <answer id="a8">
            No, there is no evidence that X-ray machines can affect the performance of the
            DigiCam or the quality of DigiCam photos.
